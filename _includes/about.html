  <h1> About Me </h1>
  <p> {{site.user_description}} </p>
  
  <p> Feel free to check out my GitHub! I version control all of my assignments and personal projects with Git and push all of them to GitHub. 
      I try to keep my repos well-documented, so if you wish to run any of my projects, just follow the instructions provided in the readme.</p>
